        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them? (Main-topic, Home page)
How can I be a better teacher? How can I be a better student? Co-worker? Leader and boss? Is there an easier way to help others to learn? This are just some of the questions that people that visit our website can have, and here in Clyteed, we have the answers to those and many other questions. We know that because that is our job! Obviously, we can’t put the answers to every single question the people might have, that is why we offer them the chance to meet with one of our coaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is planed for educators and teachers. Here people can see what are the things that Clyteed offers and what are the things that people can accomplish if they hire the services that we have to offer. There people will find the contact information and testimonies of people that have hired us and how learning from us changed their life’s.  The intended audience is mainly the people that has a teaching, educational, or leadership positions (teachers, parents, bosses, CEO’s), but all the people that desires to improve his teaching abilities or his social techniques is welcome to use our services.

      <h3>Things to do</h3>
      <p>
        What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site? (child page 1, Things to do)
Maybe they want to find some simple things to start to do to improve everything they do, that is one thing we want to add to our website those simple things. Also, we expect people to find ways to contact us, so they can learn, we will add ways of contacting us, and where they can find us.
      </p>
      <p>
        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
The most simple information is required to complete any actions in this website. The only thing they need to know is how to navigate in any website, that way they will know how to find things here. Obviously, this page will be built in a very user-friendly way so even the most unexperienced person can navigate here.

      <h3>Why us?</h3>
      <p>
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions? (child page 2, Why us?)
Every person in this planet is different, each one of us has things that have learned through the years and through those experiences we have gained knowledge and wisdom. Those are the things that here in Clyteed have, we have knowledge and wisdom and the things we have learned we came to the place that are now. The other sites can be good places to learn but they don’t have our coaches, instructors and our desire to help everyone with very low cost to the public. Some pages and institutions teach only certified teachers, but here at Clyteed, we teach to every single person that has the desire to grow and learn, that is why we are different to everyone and unique in this internet-centered world.
      </p>
      <p>
Why will people come to your site?
People will come to our site to learn how to be better teachers and instructors their respective fields. It can be hard to learn better and new teaching techniques to be better guides to the people around us, but with this website, they will learn this and many more! It’s like a hospital, we go thee when we are sick and we want something that help us to get better. Like this example, the people that visit this website has a kind of sickness (a learning-teaching sickness), and we hope that they come to us to find the cure or their illness.
