            <h2>Why would you choose us? </h2>
            <p>Every person in this planet is different, each one of us has things that have learned through the years and through those experiences we have gained knowledge and wisdom. Those are the things that here in Clyteed have.   </p>
            <p>We have knowledge and wisdom and the things we have learned we came to the place that are now. </p>

            <h2>Other places </h2>
            <p>The other sites can be good places to learn but they don’t have our coaches, instructors and our desire to help everyone with very low cost to the public. Some pages and institutions teach only certified teachers, but here at Clyteed, we teach to every single person that has the desire to grow and learn, that is why we are different to everyone and unique in this internet-centered world. </p>

            <h2>Why use Clyteed services </h2>
            <p>It can be hard to learn better and new teaching techniques to be better guides to the people around us, but with here, you will learn this and many more! It’s like a hospital, we go there when we are sick and we want something that help us to get better. Like this example, the people that visit this website has a kind of sickness (a learning-teaching sickness), and we hope that they come to us to find the cure or their illness. </p>
